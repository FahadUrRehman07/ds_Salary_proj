## ü§ñ Wed Scraping:

Tweaked the web scraper github repo **above** to scrape **1000** job posting from **glassdoor**. With each job we got the following:

* Job title.
* Salary Estimate.
* Job Description.
* Rating.
* Company.
* Location.
* Company Headquarters.
* Company Size.
* Company Founded Date.
* Type of Ownership.
* Industry.
* Sector.
* Revenue.
* Competitors

# Data Cleaning
After scraping the data. I needed to clean it up so that i was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variable.

* Parsed **numeric data out of salary**.
* Made columns for **employer provided salary** and **hourly wage**.
* Removed  rows without salary.
* Parsed **rating** out of company text.
* Made a **new column** for company state.
* Added a column for if the **job was at the company's headquarters**.
* Transformed founded **date into age of company**.
* Made column for if different **skills** were listed in the **job description**:
    - **Python**
    - **R**
    - **Excel**
    - **AWS**
    - **Spark**
* Column for simplified **job title** and **seniority**.
* Column for **description length**.


### Exploratory Data Analysis ( EDA)

### Use of Various Extended Functions - Plugins

CommonMark and GFM are great, but we often need more abstraction. The TOAST UI Editor comes with powerful **Plugins** in compliance with the Markdown syntax.

**Five basic plugins** are provided as follows, and can be downloaded and used with npm.

* [**`chart`**](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/plugins/chart) : A code block marked as a 'chart' will render [TOAST UI Chart](https://github.com/nhn/tui.chart).
* [**`code-syntax-highlight`**](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/plugins/code-syntax-highlight) : Highlight the code block area corresponding to the language provided by [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/).
* [**`color-syntax`**](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/plugins/color-syntax) : 
Using [TOAST UI ColorPicker](https://github.com/nhn/tui.color-picker), you can change the color of the editing text with the GUI.
* [**`table-merged-cell`**](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/plugins/table-merged-cell) : 
You can merge columns of the table header and body area.
* [**`uml`**](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/plugins/uml) : A code block marked as an 'uml' will render [UML diagrams](http://plantuml.com/screenshot).

## üé® Features

* [Viewer](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/docs/en/viewer.md) : Supports a mode to display only markdown data without an editing area.
* [Internationalization (i18n)](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/docs/en/i18n.md) : Supports English, Dutch, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, German, Russian, French, Ukrainian, Turkish, Finnish, Czech, Arabic, Polish, Galician, Swedish, Italian, Norwegian, Croatian + language and you can extend.
* [Widget](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/docs/en/widget.md) : This feature allows you to configure the rules that replaces the string matching to a specific `RegExp` with the widget node.
* [Custom Block](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/docs/en/custom-block.md) : Nodes not supported by Markdown can be defined through custom block. You can display the node what you want through writing the parsing logic with custom block.

## üîß Pull Request Steps

TOAST UI products are open source, so you can create a pull request(PR) after you fix issues. Run npm scripts and develop yourself with the following process.

### Setup

Fork `main` branch into your personal repository. Clone it to local computer. Install node modules. Before starting development, you should check if there are any errors.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/{your-personal-repo}/tui.editor.git
$ npm install
$ npm run build toastmark
$ npm run test editor
```

> TOAST UI Editor uses [npm workspace](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces/), so you need to set the environment based on [npm7](https://github.blog/2021-02-02-npm-7-is-now-generally-available/). If subversion is used, dependencies must be installed by moving direct paths per package.

### Develop

You can see your code reflected as soon as you save the code by running a server. Don't miss adding test cases and then make green rights.

#### Run snowpack-dev-server
[snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) allows you to run a development server without bundling.

``` sh
$ npm run serve editor
```

#### Run webpack-dev-server
If testing of legacy browsers is required, the development server can still be run using a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

``` sh
$ npm run serve:ie editor
```

#### Run test

``` sh
$ npm test editor
```

### Pull Request

Before uploading your PR, run test one last time to check if there are any errors. If it has no errors, commit and then push it!
